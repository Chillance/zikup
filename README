zikup
-----

I wanted a tool that would backup files into an archive and have the date
and keep latest X files. I didn't find anything usable, so I thought I
write it myself!

zikup = zip + backup in case someone wonders. :)

It's currently using 7-zip to compress and create the archive. This can
obviously be changed to use a module or something else later, but it's
fine for me now as this tool exists in both Windows and Linux.

zikup <backup path> <projectname> <total amount of archives> <files_or_paths...>

 <backup path> - Path where the backup (archive) is supposed to be.
 <projectname> - Name of the arhicve. It will end up like so:
                   projectname_YYYY-MM-DD_HH.MM.SS.zip where
                      YYYY is year,
                      MM is month,
                      DD is date,
                      HH is hour,
                      MM is minute,
                      SS is seconds.
 <total amount of archives> - Amount of archives to keep. Currently it will
                              create the archive before deleting the oldest
                              one, if the current archiving works.
                              Not sure we want this, or delete the file
                              first...
 <files_or_paths> - What to archive. Can be either a path to a directory or
                    a file. Also, this can be repeated to include several
                    files or paths.


Enjoy,
Chillance
